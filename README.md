# Robot Movement System
This project implements a robot movement system where robots listen to inputs and make movements based on the input provided. Each input consists of a two-letter code, where the first letter represents a direction (North, East, West, or South), and the second letter represents the number of steps to move in that direction.

# Features
Create multiple robots.
Associate each robot with a unique number.
Move a selected robot in the terrain based on the input.
Handle collisions: If there is already a robot at the destination cell, the moving robot stops in the previous cell.
Display the current location of the selected robot in the terrain.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
